This PowerShell script is designed to identify all inactive computers in Active Directory and move them to a specific OU then disable the computer account. It will also set a description to say when the computer was account was disabled.

 

The script can be customised with the source search OU, the desitnation OU, the period of inacitivy, and the description set.

 

The script does rely on quest powershell tools which can be downloaded from the Quest website.
