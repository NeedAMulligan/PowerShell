This “Get-LockedOutUser.ps1“ script allows you to specify the following via parameter input to narrow down the results:

Specific userid, defaulting to all locked out userid’s
Start time to begin searching records for, defaulting to the last three days
Domain name to search for lockouts in, defaulting to the user’s domain who is running the script

Note: This script uses the "Using" scope modifier which is a feature that was introduced in PowerShell version 3 so that is the minimum requirement. Note that the error: "A null value was encountered in the StartTime hash table key. Null values are not permitted." will be generated if you attempt to run this script from a machine that is running PowerShell version 2.
